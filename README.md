###About to-do lists
A todo list is a list of tasks that need to be accomplished before a due date. New tasks are added to the list when needed and completed tasks are crossed out. Tasks may be ordered based on the priority.

Todo lists help people keep track of tasks without having to memorize them.

###Objectives
We are going to build a to-do list application that will be executed from the browser.

###Features
The to-do list application should enable users:
  + Add new tasks
  + Cross-out tasks that have been completed.
  + Maintain a count of tasks that have been completed.
  + Maintain a count of tasks that have yet to be completed

The to-do list appliction may possess additional features such as:
  + Persisting the tasks to the browser's local storage.

###Constraints
The to-do list application must meet the following constraints:
**Technical Constraints**
  + The application must be built with the jQuery Javascript library.
  + The application must utilize the OLP.

**Design Constraints**
  + The various sections and elements of the to-do list application should be referenced by properties of the application object. These attributes have been provided for you in the application's script file. DO NOT change the ids of the elements or the names of the methods and attributes.
